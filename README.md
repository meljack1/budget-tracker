## Description
A budget tracker application built using Node.js with an Express.js server, and MongoDB using Mongoose, built as a PWA that works both online and offline. In creating this application I was able to better understand what a PWA is and the importance of offline support. 

## Installation
Navigate to ```./budget-tracker```

Run the following command from the terminal: 

```npm i```

## Usage
This application is deployed to Heroku at [mels-budget-tracker.herokuapp.com](https://mels-budget-tracker.herokuapp.com/). 

To run the application on a local server, follow the following steps: 

1. Ensure MongoDB is installed and set up on your computer before using this application. A guide can be found [here](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/installation/)

2. Navigate to ```./budget-tracker```

3. Open a new terminal and run the following command:

```npm start```
